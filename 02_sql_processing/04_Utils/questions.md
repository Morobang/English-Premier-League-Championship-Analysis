## Implementation Notes

### Power BI Considerations
- Design interactive filters for:
  - Team selection
  - Season range
  - Match type (home/away)
  - Competition tier
  - Time periods

- Include visualizations for:
  - Performance trend lines
  - Comparative bar charts
  - Geographical distributions
  - Heatmaps for frequency analysis
  - Scatter plots for correlations

- Implement drill-down capabilities for:
  - Team-to-player analysis
  - Season-to-match breakdowns
  - Aggregate-to-individual metrics

### Dashboard Requirements
- Create separate pages for:
  1. Team profiles
  2. Match analysis
  3. Season trends
  4. Referee impacts
  5. Head-to-head comparisons
  6. Streak analysis

- Include summary KPIs for:
  - Win percentages
