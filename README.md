![Premier League Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Premier_League_Logo.svg/1200px-Premier_League_Logo.svg.png) 

A comprehensive data analytics project exploring over 30 years of match results and statistics from the English Premier League (EPL) and EFL Championship (1993/94 â€“ 2024/25 Mid Season). The analysis covers thousands of matches using a structured approach built on SQL, Python, and Power BI.

This repository serves as the central hub for the project, containing scripts, datasets, visualizations, and documentation â€” all organized following a modern data architecture and engineering workflow.

##  About the Project

This project transforms raw football match data into structured, insightful information through a layered data architecture.

- **Primary focus:** SQL-based data transformation and modeling
- **Support tools:** Python (for visualizations & exploration), Power BI (for dashboards)
- **Goal:** Build reusable, modular workflows to analyze team performance, referee behavior, trends, and outliers in English football

Each section of the project is documented in its own folder with a dedicated `README.md` explaining its purpose.

##  Tools & Technologies

The project is powered by the following tools:

- **SQL Server** â€“ Core data transformation and modeling (main tool)
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)** â€“ Data exploration & visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks** â€“ Interactive analysis and documentation
- **Power BI** â€“ Interactive dashboards and business intelligence reporting

 **Tool Setup Guide:**  
All tool installation steps are documented in a separate repo:

## Data Architecture â€“ Medallion Model

The project follows a **Medallion Architecture** with three layers of data:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingested from CSV files
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and structured tables with validated types and formats
- **Gold Layer**: Final analytical models (fact and dimension tables) for analysis and reporting

This approach enables consistent data quality, maintainability, and traceability across the data lifecycle.

##  Project Structure Overview

Each folder in this repository includes a dedicated `README.md` to explain its purpose. Below is a high-level summary:

- `data/` â€“ Raw and cleaned match datasets  
- `scripts/` â€“ SQL scripts for all layers: Bronze, Silver, Gold  
- `notebooks/` â€“ Python notebooks for analysis and visual exploration  
- `powerbi/` â€“ Power BI dashboards and exported visuals  
- `04_Utils/` â€“ Python scripts, reusable SQL files, and helper documentation  
- `docs/` â€“ Additional documentation and reporting assets
