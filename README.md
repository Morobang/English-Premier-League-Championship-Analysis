#  English Premier League & Championship Analysis

![Premier League Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Premier_League_Logo.svg/1200px-Premier_League_Logo.svg.png)

A comprehensive data analytics project exploring over 30 years of match results and statistics from the English Premier League (EPL) and EFL Championship (1993/94 â€“ 2024/25 Mid Season). The analysis covers thousands of matches using a structured approach built on SQL, Python, and Power BI.

This repository serves as the central hub for the project, containing scripts, datasets, visualizations, and documentation â€” all organized following a modern data architecture and engineering workflow.

## Project Overview & Structure


This project is built to transform raw English football match data into structured, analytical models using a **layered data architecture** and modern data tooling.

-  **Primary Focus:** SQL-driven data transformation and modeling (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold)
-  **Support Tools:** Python for exploratory analysis and Power BI for dashboards
-  **Objective:** Develop a reusable analytics workflow to explore trends, team performance, referee patterns, and anomalies over a 30+ year span

Each major folder in the project has a dedicated `README.md` that explains its purpose in detail.

## Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Analyze trends in match results, team performance, and referee behavior
- Identify outliers, rivalries, and performance shifts over time
- Visualize findings using Python & Power BI
- Write reusable SQL queries for key insights

## Tools & Technologies

The project is powered by the following tools:

- **SQL Server** â€“ Core data transformation and modeling (main tool)
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)** â€“ Data exploration & visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks** â€“ Interactive analysis and documentation
- **Power BI** â€“ Interactive dashboards and business intelligence reporting

**Tool Setup Guide:**  
All tool installation steps are documented in a separate repo:

## Data Architecture â€“ Medallion Model

The project follows a **Medallion Architecture** with three layers of data:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingested from CSV files
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and structured tables with validated types and formats
- **Gold Layer**: Final analytical models (fact and dimension tables) for analysis and reporting

This approach enables consistent data quality, maintainability, and traceability across the data lifecycle.
